       <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Andrea Jared. I have spent many years in the hospitality industry. I started as a busser and worked my way to the Food and Beverage Director. After spending so many years in this field, I believe it's time to move on and learn a new set of skills. I have always been interested in web development. My goal for my future is to be in cyper security. There is no problem that I can not find a solution to given some thought. Web development is only the begining and I will succeed. I'm still learning so some mistakes will happen but i wont give up.
